# macleanup — Project Rules

## Source maps — disabled by default — RULE
Never generate source maps for this project unless the owner (aoneahsan) explicitly requests them.
Production / build / published output must ship WITHOUT source maps — no `.map` files and no
`//# sourceMappingURL` in shipped assets.

- **Vite**: `build.sourcemap: false` in `vite.config.*`.
- **Rollup**: `output.sourcemap: false` on every output.
- **Webpack**: production `devtool: false` (dev-only inline maps for local debugging are allowed).
- **tsup**: `sourcemap: false`.
- **tsconfig** (library / `tsc` builds): `"sourceMap": false`, `"inlineSourceMap": false`, `"declarationMap": false`.

Dev-only inline source maps for local debugging are fine; never emit source maps in production / published
output. Do NOT re-enable production source maps or delete these settings. Only the owner, by an explicit
request, may turn production source maps on (e.g. a one-off Sentry upload).
