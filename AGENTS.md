# macleanup — Project Rules

## Sub-agents & Skills — Main-Context-First (IRON-SOLID)
Default/built-in sub-agents (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `claude`, `fork`, …) do NOT have
access to `/skills`, so delegating to them silently SKIPS the skills RULE #0 requires — a confirmed
process failure. So: **do all skill-relevant work in the MAIN context** (where every matching Skill
can be invoked); use a sub-agent ONLY when a **custom** agent exists in `.claude/agents/` for that
job (and only within its scope); a default `Explore`/`Plan` agent is allowed ONLY for read-only,
no-skill search/exploration; and when a relevant skill is missing, **download/enable/install it**
rather than proceeding skill-less. (Owner directive 2026-07-11; full text in `~/.claude/AGENTS.md`.)

## Source maps — disabled by default — RULE
Never generate source maps for this project unless the owner (aoneahsan) explicitly requests them.
Production / build / published output must ship WITHOUT source maps — no `.map` files and no
`//# sourceMappingURL` in shipped assets.

- **Vite**: `build.sourcemap: false` in `vite.config.*`.
- **Rollup**: `output.sourcemap: false` on every output.
- **Webpack**: production `devtool: false` (dev-only inline maps for local debugging are allowed).
- **tsup**: `sourcemap: false`.
- **tsconfig** (library / `tsc` builds): `"sourceMap": false`, `"inlineSourceMap": false`, `"declarationMap": false`.

Dev-only inline source maps for local debugging are fine; never emit source maps in production / published
output. Do NOT re-enable production source maps or delete these settings. Only the owner, by an explicit
request, may turn production source maps on (e.g. a one-off Sentry upload).

## Main-Context + Skills + Model Workflow (IRON-SOLID — CRITICAL)
1. **NO default/built-in sub-agents** (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `claude`, `fork`, …) for ANY work in
   this project — they cannot invoke /skills, which RULE #0 makes mandatory. Do ALL work (planning, implementation,
   review, exploration) in the MAIN context. A sub-agent is allowed ONLY when a CUSTOM agent exists in
   `.claude/agents/` for that exact job.
2. **Skills always:** before any task, scan the available-skills list and invoke EVERY relevant skill; if a needed
   skill is missing, download/enable/install it (or use the nearest installed equivalent and say so) — never
   proceed skill-less.
3. **Model workflow:** PLAN and REVIEW on **Fable 5**; EXECUTE the approved plan on **Opus 4.8**. Plans in
   `~/.claude/plans/`; multi-phase features keep a resumable tracker (`docs/features/<slug>/00-tracker.json`),
   resumed rather than re-planned from zero.

Global records (rules, policy, audit reports) live in the `ahsan-notebook` repo at
`static/assets/claude-code/`; the `~/.claude/…` paths are symlinks into it. Full text: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
