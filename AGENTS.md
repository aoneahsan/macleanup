# macleanup — Project Rules

## Sub-agents & Skills — Main-Context-First (IRON-SOLID)
Default/built-in sub-agents (`general-purpose`, `Explore`, `Plan`, `claude`, `fork`, …) do NOT have
access to `/skills`, so delegating to them silently SKIPS the skills RULE #0 requires — a confirmed
process failure. So: **do all skill-relevant work in the MAIN context** (where every matching Skill
can be invoked); use a sub-agent ONLY when a **custom** agent exists in `.claude/agents/` for that
job (and only within its scope); a default `Explore`/`Plan` agent is allowed ONLY for read-only,
no-skill search/exploration; and when a relevant skill is missing, **download/enable/install it**
rather than proceeding skill-less. (Owner directive 2026-07-11; full text in `~/.claude/AGENTS.md`.)

## Source maps — disabled by default — RULE
Never generate source maps for this project unless the owner (aoneahsan) explicitly requests them.
Production / build / published output must ship WITHOUT source maps — no `.map` files and no
`//# sourceMappingURL` in shipped assets.

- **Vite**: `build.sourcemap: false` in `vite.config.*`.
- **Rollup**: `output.sourcemap: false` on every output.
- **Webpack**: production `devtool: false` (dev-only inline maps for local debugging are allowed).
- **tsup**: `sourcemap: false`.
- **tsconfig** (library / `tsc` builds): `"sourceMap": false`, `"inlineSourceMap": false`, `"declarationMap": false`.

Dev-only inline source maps for local debugging are fine; never emit source maps in production / published
output. Do NOT re-enable production source maps or delete these settings. Only the owner, by an explicit
request, may turn production source maps on (e.g. a one-off Sentry upload).
